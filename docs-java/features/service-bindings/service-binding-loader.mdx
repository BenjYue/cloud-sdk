## Load Service Binding Information

The SAP Cloud SDK leverages the [BTP Environment Variable Access](https://github.com/SAP/btp-environment-variable-access) library (also known as the _Service Binding Library_).
Therefore, loading service bindings from different platforms can be achieved by including the corresponding modules of the _Service Binding Library_ depending on your needs.

For example, if you are planning to deploy your application on Cloud Foundry, service bindings are contained in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
The [`com.sap.cloud.environment.servicebinding:java-sap-vcap-services`](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.environment.servicebinding%20AND%20a:java-sap-vcap-services) dependency is designed to do exactly that.
Therefore, including the dependency is already enough to support that usecase.
If you are going to deploy your application additionally to a K8s based environment, then adding the [`com.sap.cloud.environment.servicebinding:java-sap-service-operator`](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.sap.cloud.environment.servicebinding%20AND%20a:java-sap-service-operator) dependency should be sufficient.

:::note Note

As the name suggestes, the `java-sap-service-operator` module is designed to load service bindings that are created via the [SAP BTP Service Operator](https://github.com/SAP/sap-btp-service-operator).

:::

For more details, please refer to the [documentation of the _Service Binding Library_](https://github.com/SAP/btp-environment-variable-access).

## Customizing the Service Binding Loading

Application can customize the way service bindings are loaded when the [`cloudplatform-core-scp-cf`](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform/cloudplatform-core-scp-cf) module is used.
To do that, use the `ScpCfCloudPlatform#setServiceBindingAccessor(ServiceBindingAccessor)` method.

In testing scenarios, for example, it might be needed to mock the service bindings that should be used by the SAP Cloud SDK.
This can easily be achieved through the following code:

```java
final ScpCfCloudPlatform cloudPlatform = new ScpCfCloudPlatform();
cloudPlatform.setServiceBindingAccessor(() -> Collections.singletonList(mock(ServiceBinding.class)));
```

### Default behavior

If nothing else has been specified, i.e. the `ScpCfCloudPlatform#setServiceBindingAccessor(ServiceBindingAccessor)` method hasn't been used, the SAP Cloud SDK will automatically use the `DefaultServiceBindingAccessor#getInstance` to load service bindings.

:::tip Tip

The SAP Cloud SDK will always get the default `ServiceBindingAccessor` (through the `DefaultServiceBindingAccessor#getInstance` method) whenever the service bindings are requested.
That way, changing the default `ServiceBindingAccessor` (through the `DefaultServiceBindingAccessor#setInstance` method) will also affect the SAP Cloud SDK **if nothing else has been specified explicitly**.

:::

This default behavior can always be enabled by using `ScpCfCloudPlatform.setServiceBindingAccessor(null)`.
